## What Inspired It

Modern smartphones were originally conceived as personal assistants—sharp, responsive instruments to help humans communicate, navigate, and create. Over the last decade, however, the industry transformed our home screens into brightly saturated slot machines engineered by attention merchants to trigger impulsive taps and endless algorithmic scrolling.

**Minimal OS Launcher** was born at the intersection of three distinct design movements:

1. **The Minimal Phone Paradigm**:
   Embracing typography-first minimalism, anti-dopamine layouts, and e-ink aesthetic clarity. High contrast, sharp text, and zero distracting app badges.
2. **Teenage Engineering & Hardware Aesthetics**:
   Tactile, card-based retro-futuristic interfaces. Bold contrast borders, segmented micro-cards, dedicated deck drawers, and crisp mechanical visual hierarchy.
3. **Terminal Shells & T-UI Efficiency**:
   Power users love command-line shells (Bash, Zsh) because typing commands is demonstrably faster than hunting through nested graphical menus. Minimal OS translates this command-line power to touchscreens with dedicated trigger symbols (`-`, `!`, `#`, `@`, `:`, `+`, `*`, `?`, `$`, `%`, `/`), custom shortcut aliases (`yt`, `gh`, `wifi`), and bash-like command history navigation.

## What Problem Is It Solving?

### 1. The Dopamine Trap of App Grids
Traditional Android home screens blast you with colorful app icons that trigger neurological dopamine loops. You unlock your phone intending to check an email or set a timer, but notice an Instagram or YouTube icon and lose thirty minutes. **Minimal OS strips away all iconography on the home screen**, replacing apps with clean, neutral typography that requires conscious intent to open.

### 2. High Friction in Mundane Daily Actions
To take a note, set an alarm for 7:30 AM, start a 25-minute Pomodoro timer, uninstall an unused app, or text a contact, traditional OS launchers force you to find an app icon, tap it, wait for splash screens, navigate internal tabs, and execute. **In Minimal OS, the Command Bar executes all of this from one line on your home screen in under two seconds.**

### 3. The "Dumb Phone" Impasse
Many people want digital detox and try purchasing hardware "dumb phones" (feature phones or e-ink phones), only to abandon them within weeks because real life requires modern tools: banking apps, WhatsApp, ride-sharing (Uber/Lyft), 2-factor authentication, music streaming (Spotify), and GPS maps. **Minimal OS turns your existing Android device into a software-defined dumb phone**: total psychological calm without sacrificing a single critical Android application.

### 4. Poor Legibility & The White-on-White Contrast Dilemma
Many monochrome or minimalist launchers suffer from contrast failures where white accents cause invisible white text on bright elements. **Minimal OS introduces the `MinimalOnAccent` adaptive luminance engine**, ensuring that whether you run pure *AMOLED Crimson* or blindingly pure *Nordic Snow*, text, badges, checkboxes, and interactive buttons automatically switch between crisp pure black (`#000000`) and brilliant white (`#FFFFFF`) for flawless WCAG AAA legibility.

## Core Features

### 1. Type to Do Things (The Unified Command Bar)

The Command Bar is the brain of Minimal OS. It combines instant app search, contact dialing, system utility shortcuts, natural-language actions, AI assistant prompts, YouTube queries, app uninstallation, and user-defined aliases in one unified input bar.

```
Type keyword or symbol + text  ->  Instant execution
```

| Command / Symbol | Action | Example | Result |
|:---:|:---|:---|:---|
| `uninstall` or `/` | **Uninstall App** | `uninstall chatgpt` or `/chatgpt` | Prompts native confirmation dialog to uninstall the app |
| `assistant` or `?` | **AI Assistant Query** | `assistant what is gravity` | Transmits prompt directly to Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude, or Copilot |
| `yt` or `$` | **YouTube Search** | `yt lofi beats` or `$ lofi beats` | Searches directly in the YouTube Android app or web |
| `pomo` or `%` | **Live Pomodoro** | `pomo 50m` or `pomodoro 50 minute` | Starts real-time home screen Pomodoro countdown timer |
| `@` or `msg` | **Direct SMS** | `@Mom on my way home` | Opens system SMS composer pre-filled to contact |
| `#` or `call` | **Quick Call** | `#Alex` or `#+1234567890` | Instantly dials contact or raw phone number |
| `-` or `task` | **Focus Task** | `-Buy milk and coffee` | Immediately adds task to your Minimal Memo task list |
| `!` or `note` | **Memo / Note** | `!Meeting ideas for Monday` | Saves scratch note into Minimal Memo storage |
| `*` or `event` | **Calendar Event** | `*Flight to Tokyo tomorrow` | Launches calendar intent with pre-filled title |
| `+` or `timer` | **Countdown Timer** | `+15m` or `timer 45s` | Starts a system countdown timer immediately |
| `:` or `alarm` | **Clock Alarm** | `:7:00 AM` or `alarm 8:30am` | Configures system clock alarm for specified time |
| `alias` | **Custom Shortcuts** | `alias gh = https://github.com` | Configures custom user-defined keywords (URLs, apps, or settings) |
| _(app name)_ | **Fuzzy App Search** | `spot` | Real-time app search with instant keyboard launch |
| _(search query)_ | **Web Search** | `weather today` | Fast distraction-free web search in default browser |

> **Directory of 120+ Aliases & System Shortcuts**: Check out the comprehensive [ALIASES_AND_SHORTCUTS.md](ALIASES_AND_SHORTCUTS.md) directory for ready-to-use Android settings intents (`android.settings.WIFI_SETTINGS`, `BLUETOOTH_SETTINGS`, `BATTERY_SAVER_SETTINGS`), dynamic search engines with `{query}`, app package shortcuts, and instructions on finding intent actions and package IDs.

#### Terminal Power Features:
- **Interactive Command History Stream**: When typing, past commands appear in a clean, scrollable card stream. Tap any entry to reload it into the command bar ready to edit or run.
- **Terminal History Storage & Download (.md)**: All terminal commands are continuously logged to a structured markdown file (`minimal_command_history.md`). Users can export and download this `.md` file at any time from Settings using the Android Storage Access Framework.
- **Command History Toggle**: Enable or disable terminal command history recording anytime in Settings.
- **Dynamic Multiline Auto-Expansion**: The command bar automatically expands from 1 line up to 3 lines when typing lengthy notes, tasks, or search queries, eliminating horizontal truncation.
- **Terminal Up/Down Cycling Controls**: Tactile Up and Down controls step through terminal history anytime with live badge tracking (`HIST 1/10`).
- **Inline Syntax Highlighting**: Only the action trigger or alias (such as `uninstall`, `yt`, `pomo`, `assistant`, `todo`, `notes`, `-`, `!`, `#`) lights up in bold theme accent color, while parameters and payload text stay clean, crisp white.
- **Interactive Uninstall Suggestions**: Typing `uninstall` or `uninstall <query>` displays matching installed apps with a dedicated `UNINSTALL` action badge. Tapping any app directly triggers the native system deletion confirmation dialog.
- **Smart Contact Search**: Search your address book with fuzzy matching and inline permission grant fallbacks.

- **Live Pomodoro Focus Card**: Built-in 15m, 25m, 45m, and 60m focus chips, custom duration picker dialog, work/break cycle tracker, and tactile play/pause/reset controls. Can also be pinned directly onto the **Home Screen** widgets deck with live countdown controls and matching card width.
- **Custom Alarms & Live Alarm Countdown**: Tactile custom time-picker dialog with full Hour (1–12), Minute (00–59), AM/PM toggles, and Date selection chips plus relative quick presets (`+15m`, `+30m`, `+1h`, `+8h`). Features a **Home Screen Live Alarm Countdown Widget** showing exact time remaining until the next system alarm rings.
- **Minimal Memo with Search & Direct Creation**: Full-featured quick memos and focus tasks. Includes a dedicated real-time **Search Box** to filter notes and tasks, plus a context-aware **Add Input Bar** to type and create tasks or thoughts directly without leaving the sheet.
- **Aliases & Shortcuts Deck**: Quick template creator and 1-tap launcher for your custom shortcuts (e.g. `yt` -> YouTube, `wifi` -> Network Settings, `gh` -> GitHub).
- **Countdown Timers**: Quick-tap timer presets (`1m`, `5m`, `10m`, `15m`, `25m`) that trigger native Android alarms.
- **Native App Widget Host**: Pin standard Android app widgets (Spotify, Google Keep, Weather) directly into the Minimal OS card system.
