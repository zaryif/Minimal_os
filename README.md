## 💡 What Inspired It

Modern smartphones were originally conceived as personal assistants—sharp, responsive instruments to help humans communicate, navigate, and create. Over the last decade, however, the industry transformed our home screens into brightly saturated slot machines engineered by attention merchants to trigger impulsive taps and endless algorithmic scrolling.

**Minimal OS Launcher** was born at the intersection of three distinct design movements:

1. **The Minimal Phone Paradigm**:
   Embracing typography-first minimalism, anti-dopamine layouts, and e-ink aesthetic clarity. High contrast, sharp text, and zero distracting app badges.
2. **Teenage Engineering & Rabbit r1 Industrial Hardware Aesthetic**:
   Tactile, card-based retro-futuristic interfaces. Bold contrast borders, segmented micro-cards, dedicated deck drawers, and crisp mechanical visual hierarchy.
3. **Terminal Shells & T-UI Efficiency**:
   Power users love command-line shells (Bash, Zsh) because typing commands is demonstrably faster than hunting through nested graphical menus. Minimal OS translates this command-line power to touchscreens with dedicated trigger symbols (`-`, `!`, `#`, `@`, `:`, `+`, `*`, `?`), custom shortcut aliases (`yt`, `gh`, `wifi`), and bash-like command history navigation.

## 🎯 What Problem Is It Solving?

### 1. The Dopamine Trap of App Grids
Traditional Android home screens blast you with colorful app icons that trigger neurological dopamine loops. You unlock your phone intending to check an email or set a timer, but notice an Instagram or YouTube icon and lose thirty minutes. **Minimal OS strips away all iconography on the home screen**, replacing apps with clean, neutral typography that requires conscious intent to open.

### 2. High Friction in Mundane Daily Actions
To take a note, set an alarm for 7:30 AM, start a 25-minute Pomodoro timer, or text your mom, traditional OS launchers force you to find an app icon, tap it, wait for splash screens, navigate internal tabs, and execute. **In Minimal OS, the Command Bar executes all of this from one line on your home screen in under two seconds.**

### 3. The "Dumb Phone" Impasse
Many people want digital detox and try purchasing hardware "dumb phones" (feature phones or e-ink phones), only to abandon them within weeks because real life requires modern tools: banking apps, WhatsApp, ride-sharing (Uber/Lyft), 2-factor authentication, music streaming (Spotify), and GPS maps. **Minimal OS turns your existing Android device into a software-defined dumb phone**: total psychological calm without sacrificing a single critical Android application.

### 4. Poor Legibility & The White-on-White Contrast Dilemma
Many monochrome or minimalist launchers suffer from contrast failures where white accents cause invisible white text on bright elements. **Minimal OS v1.7.1 introduces the `MinimalOnAccent` adaptive luminance engine**, ensuring that whether you run pure *AMOLED Crimson* or blindingly pure *Nordic Snow*, text, badges, checkboxes, and interactive buttons automatically switch between crisp pure black (`#000000`) and brilliant white (`#FFFFFF`) for flawless WCAG AAA legibility.

## ✨ Core Features

### ⌨️ 1. Type to Do Things (The Command Bar)

The Command Bar is the brain of Minimal OS. It combines instant app search, contact dialing, system utility shortcuts, natural-language actions, and user-defined aliases in one unified input bar.

```
Type symbol + text  ➔  Instant execution
```

| Symbol / Command | Action | Example | Result |
|:---:|:---|:---|:---|
| `@` or `sms` | **Direct SMS** | `@Mom on my way home` | Opens system SMS composer pre-filled to contact |
| `#` or `call` | **Quick Call** | `#Alex` or `#+1234567890` | Instantly dials contact or raw phone number |
| `-` | **To-Do Item** | `-Buy milk and coffee` | Immediately adds item to your Minimal Memo to-do list |
| `!` | **Memo / Note** | `!Meeting ideas for Monday` | Saves scratch note into Minimal Memo storage |
| `*` | **Calendar Event** | `*Flight to Tokyo tomorrow` | Launches calendar intent with pre-filled title |
| `+` | **Timer** | `+15m` or `+45s` | Starts a system countdown timer immediately |
| `:` or `alarm` | **Alarm** | `:7:00 AM` or `alarm 8:30am` | Configures system clock alarm for specified time |
| `?` or `ask` | **Minimal Ask** | `?capital of iceland` | Fast distraction-free web search without browser tabs |
| `alias` | **Custom Shortcuts**| `yt lofi beats` or `gh notifications` | Runs custom user-defined keywords (URLs, apps, or settings) |
| _(text)_ | **Fuzzy App Search** | `spot` | Real-time app search with instant keyboard launch |

#### 🚀 Terminal Power Features:
- **Chatbox Command History Stream**: When typing, the upper screen area transforms into an interactive, scrollable chat stream (resembling ChatGPT/Gemini) displaying past commands as numbered squared cards (`[1]`, `[2]`, `[3]...`). Tap any card to reload it into the command bar ready to edit or run.
- **Dynamic Multiline Auto-Expansion**: The command bar automatically expands from 1 line up to 3 lines when typing lengthy notes, tasks, or search queries, eliminating horizontal truncation.
- **Terminal Up/Down Cycling Arrows**: Tactile `▲` (Up) and `▼` (Down) scroll buttons remain permanently anchored beside the input bar to step through terminal history anytime with live badge tracking (`HIST 1/10`).
- **Inline Syntax Highlighting**: Only the action trigger or alias (such as `todo`, `notes`, `yt`, `-`, `!`, or `#`) lights up in bold theme accent color, while parameters and payload text stay clean, crisp white.
- **Smart Contact Search**: Search your address book with fuzzy matching and inline permission grant fallbacks.

### 🗂️ 2. The Widgets Deck Screen (Dedicated Utilities Hub)

Swipe or tap into the **Widgets Deck** to access purpose-built, high-contrast utility cards inspired by retro-futuristic hardware:

- ⏱️ **Live Pomodoro Focus Card**: Built-in 15m, 25m, 45m, and 60m focus chips, custom duration picker dialog, work/break cycle tracker, and tactile play/pause/reset controls. Can also be pinned directly onto the **Home Screen** widgets deck with live controls and matching card width.
- ⏰ **Custom Alarms & Live Alarm Countdown**: Tactile custom time-picker dialog with full Hour (1–12), Minute (00–59), AM/PM toggles, and Day selection chips (Today, Tomorrow, Daily, Weekdays) plus relative quick presets (`+15m`, `+30m`, `+1h`, `+8h`). Features a **Home Screen Live Alarm Countdown Widget** showing exact time remaining until the next system alarm rings.
- 📝 **Minimal Memo with Search & Direct Creation**: Full-featured quick memos and to-dos. Includes a dedicated real-time **Search Box** to filter notes and tasks, plus a context-aware **Add Input Bar** to type and create tasks or thoughts directly without leaving the sheet.
- ⚡ **Aliases & Shortcuts Deck**: Quick template creator and 1-tap launcher for your custom shortcuts (e.g. `yt` ➔ YouTube, `wifi` ➔ Network Settings, `gh` ➔ GitHub).
- ⏲️ **Countdown Timers**: Quick-tap timer presets (`1m`, `5m`, `10m`, `15m`, `25m`) that trigger native Android alarms.
- 🧩 **Native App Widget Host**: Pin any standard Android app widget (Spotify, Google Keep, Weather) directly into the Minimal OS card system.

---

### 📬 3. Unified Notification Hub (Swipe Right)

Stop hopping between 10 different notification shades and apps. The Hub aggregates notifications into a clean, unified stream:
- **Category Tabs**: Filter by `ALL`, `MESSAGE`, `CALLS`, `EMAIL`, `APPS`, and `FLAGGED`.
- **Minimalist Metadata**: Clean typography, relative timestamps (`now`, `5m`, `2h`), and direct 1-tap interaction.
- **Privacy-Minded**: Runs completely locally on your device via Android's `NotificationListenerService`.

---

### 🛡️ 4. Digital Diet & Restriction Modes

Take back control of your screen time with hardware-like restriction profiles:
- **Monk Mode**: Ultra-restricted. Only essential phone tools, SMS, and clock are accessible. Eliminates distraction at the root.
- **Focus Mode**: Work mode. Distracting apps are restricted or placed on timed timers.
- **Unrestricted Mode**: All apps accessible when you need full freedom.

### 🎨 5. Handcrafted Theme Engine & Adaptive Contrast

Minimal OS includes 7 bespoke, high-contrast themes tailored for AMOLED displays, daylight readability, and aesthetic pleasure:

| Theme Name | Dominant Palette | Accent Color | Ideal Use Case |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **AMOLED Crimson** | Pure Pitch Black (`#000000`) | Crimson Red (`#FF3B30`) | Maximum battery saving & classic Minimal OS look |
| **Apple Space Gray** | Deep Charcoal (`#141416`) | Electric Blue (`#0A84FF`) | Sleek, modern iOS/macOS pro look |
| **Nordic Snow** | Pure Contrast Black & Crisp White | Pure White (`#FFFFFF`) | Extreme monochrome minimalism with black-on-white text |
| **Rabbit Amber** | Warm Dark Zinc (`#0D0D0F`) | Industrial Orange (`#FF5722`) | Teenage Engineering & Rabbit r1 tribute |
| **Matrix Forest** | Deep Emerald (`#070E0A`) | Terminal Green (`#10B981`) | Cyberpunk & hacker terminal aesthetic |
| **Midnight Obsidian**| Deep Space Navy (`#060913`) | Glacier Sky (`#38BDF8`) | Calming night-time low-light readability |
| **Titanium Purple** | Shadow Violet (`#0A0714`) | Electric Violet (`#A855F7`) | Rich, vibrant dark mode aesthetic |

> **Adaptive Legibility (`MinimalOnAccent`)**: Minimal OS automatically calculates background luminance. On pure white accent buttons (Nordic Snow), text and icons dynamically render in sharp pure black (`#000000`), guaranteeing zero white-on-white visibility bugs.
